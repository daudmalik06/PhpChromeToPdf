PHP ChromeToPdf provides a simple and clean interface to ease PDF and image creation with
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). **The `Google Chrome`
must be installed and working on your system.** See the section below for details.


## History
Every time i had convert url to pdf or to take screenshot of some url
i had to install several libraries , i know there are very good libraries available
like phantomJs,wkhtmltopdf and some others...
but there are always rendering issue  
like some supports **bootstrap** ,some not some time **html5 problem** etc..  
and this was all annoying
so i decided to make this little wrapper around chrome  
by using chrome results i achieved following results.  
* **No more css issues (bootstrap,css3 )**
* **No more html5 issues**
* **No more need to use xvfb**

**in-fact painless conversion**

## Setting options

The `google-chrome` shell command accepts different types of options:
for complete list of options you can visit
https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/



### Wrapper Methods


 * `constructor`: Accepts $url to visit(for pdf/screenshot) as first parameter
 you can pass this as null and later use `setUrl`, and second parameter is binary
 path of google-chrome installed in your system as second parameter if no binaryPath is provided
 is uses default location `/usr/bin/google-chrome`
 but you still can provide binary path later using `setBinaryPath`,
 constructor also put some default arguments like
 `headless , disable-gpu` which are necessary for google-chrome to work on cli
 * `setBinaryPath` which accepts binary path and set it for you
 * `setArguments` to set options of google-chrome it accepts array of options in a format
 ```
 [
    $argument1=>$value1,
    $argument2=>$value2,  
 ]
 ```
if your argument doesn't has values like `--headless` you can pass empty value
 e.g
 `[--headless=>'']`
* `setArgument` to set option of google-chrome it accepts two parameter $argument , $value
 if your argument doesn't has a value like `--headless` you can pass empty value e.g
 `setArgument('--headless','')`

* `setChromeDirectory` the directory where google-chrome will save your profile
    it is not mandatory as google-chrome by default uses some directory but in need
    you can use this method to change that
* `setUrl` to set the url to convert to pdf or to take screenshot    

* `useHtmlFile` to use the file instead of url to convert to pdf or to take screenshot    

* `useHtml` to use the html code instead of url to convert to pdf or to take screenshot    

* `setOutputDirectory` directory to save the output (screenshots and pdf) the
default directory is temporary directory of your operating system

* `getPdf` it receives optional path parameter to save the pdf file at
if not provided it will save in output directory or temp directory of your
operating system depending if you properly set up the output directory,  
for this check `setOutputDirectory` option,  
it will convert your provided url to pdf and return the
location of newly saved pdf

* `getScreenShot` it receives optional path parameter to save the pdf file at
if not provided it will save in output directory or temp directory of your
operating system depending if you properly set up the output directory  
for this check `setOutputDirectory` option,  
it will take screenshot of your provided url and return the
location of newly saved image

* `setWindowSize` you can set the chrome window size using this method
it accepts two parameters $width and $height

* `useMobileScreen` ask chrome to access site as mobile browser

* `getArguments` returns all the arguments set

there are some other getters available too in case you need
 `getUrl , getBinaryPath , getOutputDirectory`
